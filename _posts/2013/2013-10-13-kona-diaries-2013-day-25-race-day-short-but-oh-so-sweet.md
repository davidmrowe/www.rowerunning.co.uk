It's 6:30am on Sunday and I just wanted to share this photo with you that I took yesterday evening. I finished the race, it was tough, it was amazing, I was immensily proud of how I did all things considering and I have a huge medal that's going to make me look like Mr T from the A-Team when I go through the airport in a few days time.

I had a great swim, my legs just weren't feeling it at all on the bike and the run was for survival. 10 hours 29 minutes and 27 seconds.

The race was amazing. And coming back for the finish line party to cheer on the final finishers for the last few hours was unbelievable. The best race finishing area I've ever been to.

For now I'll leave you with this photo as I need to be at the Ironman shop by the pier for 7am as they're putting 'Official Finisher' clothing on sale. That'll no doubt keep the credit card people happy!
