So, when I walked up on stage at the prizegiving ceremony after Ironman UK last month I was probably the only first place (or even podium) finisher without shaved legs! To be honest I've never had the desire to shave my legs - heck I don't even shave my face!

During the past few months I've had a little bit of stick from a few, er, friends regarding the hairy-growth coming from my lower limbs. Those boys at [Black Line London](http://www.blacklinelondon.com/) are mostly to blame to be honest. On a long bike ride down to Brighton and back in August I got a fair amount of stick from those silky smooth legged 'men.' OK, I admit that perhaps I was a little vain when I bought water 'with a hint of strawberry' from the garage to refill my water bottles on the way back, but to be honest I was lucky they even spoke to me with my legs that day!

I will not succumb to peer pressure. I will not succumb to peer pressure. I will not succumb...

When I completed my first Ironman in 2009 I had every intention of getting an Ironman tattoo ([see examples of which that people have over at Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1105&bih=735&q=ironman+tattoo&oq=ironman+tattoo)). I ummed and ahhed for a couple of weeks and then it just never happened. I then said that I'd not get one unless I ever made it to the holy grail of Ironman - the world championships in Hawaii. Doh! Well, I've still no plans to get one.

As for shaving my legs, from what I hear they won't let you and your bike off of the plane and through immigration at Kona airport if you've got hairy legs, so it has to be done!

However, a little leg hair - it'll grow back. What's the big deal.

I've had a few discussions with Sharon about how to approach this life changing moment and a conversation we had seemed to move onto twitter a few days ago whilst I was out swimming. By the time I had finished Sharon and our friend Emma had discussed the reasons (for ease of massage or vanity - vanity of course!!) and technique to use. Suggestions like the following were banded around...

> "I thought we would clipper him, then shave...he won't be waxed."
> 
> "Clipper all trouser area, shave what isn't under shorts?"

Bloody hell, this is all a bit complicated.

Well, lets just say that this afternoon I spent some 'me' time in the bathroom with my charged up clippers and I've done what I believe will be acceptable enough to let me off of the plane. I'm now almost as smooth as a babies bottom. However, I have a suspicion that I'll be itching like I'm covered in fleas tonight!

As for my face. The hair is staying put.
