It's exactly one month until the 2013 Ironman World Chamionships. Aarrrrggghhhh!!!!

Anyway, moving on... over the past few weeks I've spent a lot (and I mean a lot!) of time thinking about Kona. I've been watching old Ironman videos on YouTube (well, I've actually got them all on my computer for safe keeping and instant availability!) and reading as much information as I can about the race and the big island of Hawaii.

One set of videos that I've really enjoyed watching (other than the 'official NBC TV coverage') is [these ones from 32konatown on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-D4iPLxH0klUPSYDFpTT8ELtd0tBMmc). They give a great idea of what the race is about from a spectators point of view. Really good to watch.

As well as watching endless videos of the race I've read quite a few race reports from people who've been there. I'm currently working through the [fantastic archive of (almost daily) reports from fellow UK age group athlete Steven Lord](http://www.stevenlord.me.uk/STL/Blog/files/category-kona.php) during his many visits to the big island. Of course being a 'pirate' I must not forget the [great race reports and photos from Rosey](http://ironrosey.com/) (who's been to Kona twice) that are over at his website.

I'll be out there fairly soon to get myself in as good a position that I can to enjoy the race and get to that finish line on 12 October. Although I'm not planning on running right now I want to continue my current good streak of swim training and also get some bike miles in on the roads through the lava-fields in the lead up to the race.

If you keep an eye on this blog you won't miss a thing as I'll be posting regular updates for the next month!
