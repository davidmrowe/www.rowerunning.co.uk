Another day of thinking about nothing else apart from the marathon.

Yesterday we watched the start of the Paris Marathon live at 8am, then I went for a run and arrived home to catch the finish of the Rotterdam Marathon. Then last night we watched the BBC London Marathon highlights program from 2009.

Today I watched the Boston Marathon on telly. Twice. Don't ask. Each individual watching was split up by a massage.

Suffice to say, my "thinking about nothing else apart from the marathon" problem has not been helped by my recent viewing.

On Tuesday I plan to go for a run to clear my head.
