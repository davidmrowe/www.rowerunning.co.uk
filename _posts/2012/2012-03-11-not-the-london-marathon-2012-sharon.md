You might not realise but I am training for the London Marathon. I got a place last year which I deferred and then this year I deliberated long and hard about taking up the place but decided to at least give myself the option of getting on the start line.

Anyway, I have been trying to keep to my Hal Higdon Schedule (novice 1 if you're wondering) but things have conspired against me a little. However, here we are, 6 weeks away. 18 miles on the schedule. I've only run 13.2 miles before. In my head, if I didn't do this 18, there was no way I could even contemplate standing on the start line at London.

David has [blogged about what NTLM is](/2012/03/not-the-london-marathon-2012-david/ "Not The London Marathon 2012 (David)"), so I shall not do that. I had been very nervous about 18 miles, it's quite a long way you know ;) Anyway, off we set. My plan was 11 minutes per mile, I had to really not set off too fast, which is my habit. I ran most of the first 2 laps with Emma, caught up to Ann and Jan, then along came Anna and Deb, who were a little bit late, so I ran with them for a while...kept trying to send people away as I didn't want to slow them down but they wouldn't go.

The miles ticked on by, I was having some gels and sports drink, before we knew it (ahem!) we were on the 5th lap. I really should have had my 4th gel about a kilometre before I did but there you go, that's what you do these practise runs for I guess. So, last gel, then off we went onto the 6th lap. At 16.75 miles I lost the plot a bit and threw my toys out of the pram! I sent everyone away (what goes on in my head to do that?) and plodded on - still on my target pace though. Before long, Deb came back for me and I had done it. I had run 18 miles. Average pace was 10:54, so perfect.

David had whizzed along for his 18+ miles and greeted me with drinks at the end. I was feeling a bit wibbly wobbly, so drank some milkshake, got some warm clothes on and after a chat in the sunshine, headed off home. Thanks so much to Anna, Deb and Ann who ran with me for much of the time (or tried to before I banished them!).

Things went a big wrong at this point, I felt awful in the car, didn't know what to do with myself. TMI Alert: Got home, in the front door and threw up! Luckily only into my hands as I ran up the stairs and not onto the carpet ;) All the stuff I had consumed after running, gone into the toilet. Rats. Tried to drink something else a bit later, once again down the loo. I don't know why, there's been a few suggestions made, I will try other things. Either way, I felt rotten for quite a few hours.

I am trying to take the positives from this run, currently the throwing up experience is over-shadowing my delight at running 18 miles...but I will try and let the delight back in later tonight :)
