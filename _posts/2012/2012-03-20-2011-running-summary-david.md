I normally post my annual summary at the beginning of January but completely forgot about it! So this time it'll be short and sweet...

In 2011 I ran my most ever mileage (only by about 20 miles more than in 2007, but it's still more) with 1,346 miles (this isn't 100 percent accurate as I didn't log every run but it's close enough). This averages out to around 25 miles per week. Not a great deal but with all the other training I'd been doing then it's not too bad.

After the cancellation of the [Luton Marathon](/2010/12/luton-marathon-2010-or-not/ "Luton Marathon 2010....or not!") in December 2010 focus was quickly shifted to the Brighton Marathon in April. I wanted to run under three hours and 10 minutes to get a ['Good For Age' time](http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/enter-virgin-london-marathon/good-for-age-entries/) for the London Marathon. Unfortunately I was ill a couple of weeks beforehand and although I felt good on the day it didn't last long and I [missed out big time](/2011/04/brighton-marathon-2011-not-my-greatest-day/ "Brighton Marathon 2011 - Not my greatest day!") on getting a sub 3:10 race.

A few weeks later I ran (for the eighth year in a row) the [Bognor Regis 10k](/2011/05/bognor-prom-10k-15-may-2011/ "Bognor Prom 10k - 15 May 2011") which I love. 38:03 and a new personal time over the distance. All good stuff. Apart from parkrun events I ran a few smaller races, a [7k](/2011/07/the-31st-wedding-day-7k-race/ "The 31st Wedding Day 7k Race"), a [10](/2011/10/cabbage-patch-10-16-october-2011/ "Cabbage Patch 10 - 16 October 2011") miler, a hilly race called the [Three Molehills](/2011/11/the-three-molehills-27-november-2011/ "The Three Molehills - 27 November 2011") (it was tough... real tough) and then the [Bedford Half Marathon](/2011/12/bedford-harriers-half-marathon-2011-david/ "Bedford Harriers Half Marathon 2011 (David)") in December (after cycling 55 miles to the start!).

Triathlon wise things were pretty quiet. The only races I did were Thames Turbo Triathlon Club events - I raced their [annual aquathlon](/2011/07/thames-turbo-aquathlon-23-june-2011/ "Thames Turbo Aquathlon - 23 June 2011") (run and swim) and two of their sprint triathlons. I got my best time ever in the [August race](/2011/09/thames-turbo-triathlon-2011-series-race-4/ "Thames Turbo Triathlon 2011 Series - Race 4") which I was really pleased with. I had entered a couple of half ironman distance events but for one reason or another I didn't make the start line of either. So.. my triathlon racing was a couple of sprint events with the last one in August. Probably not the greatest preparation for the Ironman distance event that I'd entered in January 2012.

Finally here's the (usual) graph showing my running distances over the past few years...
