*Look how much fun I'm having!*

Apparently they are good for you (according to some coaches/runners) apparently they reduce your immune system (according to others) and apparently David likes to torture me. Whichever you choose to believe, I was greeted on my arrival home from my longest ever training run on Tuesday with a bath of cold water. Nice. I have to say, my legs were much better afterwards even though I only managed 5 minutes in it, I think it's meant to be minimum 10 minutes.
