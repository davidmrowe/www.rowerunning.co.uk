All of sudden, it's, "the day before the London Marathon". Gosh, that came around quickly ;)

This morning saw me at Bushy parkrun, taking some photos (including photos of a certain Special parkrun Person getting a shiny PB, awesome!) and meeting parkrunners and parkrun Event Directors from far and wide. It was a great morning, I must say. When Paul looks around and sees what he has created and how people come together from all over the world as a result of his amazing idea, he must be very proud.

I had a chat to the ever-lovely Ann, then suddenly I was feeling excited. It's the first time I have felt this way, rather than merely petrified, so it was nice. I then ran around a few people, wishing luck to some, having hugs and, "Good luck, be strong" words from others. It was bizarre. For the record, I am currently firmly back in the terrified camp ;)

So, in amongst all the lovely cards and emails and texts and tweets and calls and facebook messages, I found time this afternoon to pin on my number, attach my chip to my shoe and make some cakes (some of which were given to Kirsty as normally I am in charge of the Marathon supporting picnic, so I wanted to at least provide a small contribution to it). The rest of the evening will involve dinner, packing my bag for the morning, then try to get some sleep.

*All ready to go!*

I cannot believe that this time tomorrow it will all be over. All these weeks and weeks of training. I hope that it ends in the way I want it to.

Bring. It. On.
