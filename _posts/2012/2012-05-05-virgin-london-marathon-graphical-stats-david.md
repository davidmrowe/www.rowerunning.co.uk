I just thought I'd post this graphic which is now available for all runners of the 2012 London Marathon on the results website. This gives a good overview of how I did during the race compared to other runners. The graphics are created by [runpix.net](http://www.runpix.net/) and I think it's pretty cool for something so simple.

The most interesting thing for me here is the data on how I ran during the last 7km (from 35 to 42km). Apparently I overtook 455 runners during this time, and only 5 runners passed me. As I said in [my race report](/2012/04/virgin-london-marathon-22-april-2012-david/ "Virgin London Marathon - 22 April 2012") I kept my pace going steady until the finish, which clearly was not quite the same for just about everyone else around me. I'll take that as a positive thing :)
