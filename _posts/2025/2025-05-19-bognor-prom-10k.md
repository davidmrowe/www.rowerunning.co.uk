excerpt: One of my favourite races on the calendar

---
This was my 15th time running the Bognor Prom 10k.  In 2023 I didn't take part through injury and in 2024 Sharon and I volunteered and helped marshal part of the route.  It was most enjoyable and there were no incidents of note - which I suppose is why it was enjoyable.

This year's race was three weeks after the [London Marathon](/2025/05/london-marathon-27-april-2025) - which broke me good and proper.  I really struggled in the immediate days that followed but managed five miles running the following week and then 15 miles the week after.  A few runs ahead of the 10k and I was ready to go.  I'd done no speed training other than at parkrun all year - and 5km fast doesn't mean you can run 10k fast!  I was hoping my marathon fitness would help.

The weather was perfect with loads of sunshine and a very light wind.

I had no expectations at all for the 10k other than thinking that I wanted to start with or near to the 45 minute pacer and go from there based on feel.

I got carried away!

I went through the first mile at about 42 minute pace.  This felt OK (to be fair it always feels OK for the first mile) but I was trying to hold back a little.  The miles ticked over and there were plenty of people around me to run with.

I got to the 5k point in 21:10 which I was really happy with - it was just a case of being able to maintain that pace and do it all again.

I do love this event and running through your home town/village and knowing lots of people running and lots who are supporting at the roadside makes it special.

The last couple of miles I actually started to push a little harder and somehow was able to do so.  I ran into the finish line, stopped my watch and it said 41:48 - meaning that I ran the second half quicker than the first - probably one of the only 'negative splits' I've ever done in a race.

I was really happy with my time - and post race cheered many of the other runners in and stopped off at the local pub for a free beer (for all runners) before heading home.
