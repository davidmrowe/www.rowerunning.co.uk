Quick update on Saturdays 5k time trial. Both Sharon and I were "taking it easy" (famous last words) as we're racing the following day and we both finished in very respectable times - I finished in 19:45 and Sharon in 30:21. Both our times were just over a minute slower than our PB's (personal best) which was fine. With a pasta dinner we should be ready for the Sutton 10k on Sunday.
