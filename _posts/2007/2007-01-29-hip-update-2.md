Quick update... Had the MRI scan and X-Ray this morning at my local hospital. Lets just say I'm glad that its being covered by medical insurance as the MRI scan cost just under 700 pounds! Seeing the specialist on Thursday where he'll have a look at the results. I'll post another update at the end of the week.
