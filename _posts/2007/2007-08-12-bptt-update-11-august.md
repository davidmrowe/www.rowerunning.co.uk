Yesterday Sharon and I were taking it easy(ish) because we're racing on Sunday. I (David) ran a comfortable 19:40. Interestingly when I first ran 19:40 on 16th December last year (2006), my average heart rate was 178. Today it was 165.

Sharon ran her 5k in 29:19 and was happy with this, feeling very relaxed and pacing someone around to her first sub-30 minute 5km.

We followed this up with a swim at Teddington Pool and then lunch at Caffe Caffe. What a nice day...all good race preparation we hoped.
