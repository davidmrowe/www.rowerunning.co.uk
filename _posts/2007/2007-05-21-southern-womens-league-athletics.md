On Saturday 19 May we headed along to St. Mary's Richmond Athletics Club to watch the Southern Womens League athletics meeting. It was great to see so many fit ;) women running around the track! A number of [photos that I took can be found at our photo site](http://davidrowe.co.uk/photos/72157600234241374/).
