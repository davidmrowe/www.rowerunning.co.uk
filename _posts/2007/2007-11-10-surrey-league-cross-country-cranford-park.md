[![20071110-surrey_league_sharon.jpg](/images/2007/20071110-surrey_league_sharon.jpg)](http://rowephoto.co.uk/photos/72157603061520228/)Today was the second ladies race in Division 1 of the [Surrey League Cross Country series](http://www.surreyathletics.org.uk/crosscountry/2007_2008/leagues/slccl.htm) for 2007-2008. David and I watched the first races (womens and mens) a few weeks ago and today I took part in my first Surrey League race.

The race was held at [Cranford Park](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=cranford+park&sll=51.854267,-2.182928&sspn=0.014075,0.034461&ie=UTF8&ll=51.486808,-0.414176&spn=0.01419,0.034461&t=h&z=15&iwloc=addr&om=1) (right by junction 3 of the M4 motorway in west London) and it was a very flat grass course, with a little stream in the middle to add a little variety. It was a two lap course - a total of about 3.5 miles.

I was last Ranelagh home (that's OK, don't feel sorry for me!) but that's only because the slower runners seem not to take part in events like this - perhaps they don't want to be last? There were lots of people still behind me and I had an excellent finish, making up a good few places over the last half mile or so. The only downside to the race was going straight to work afterwards...
