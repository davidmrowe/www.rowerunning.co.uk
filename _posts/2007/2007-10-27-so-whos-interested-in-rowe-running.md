This morning I was asked if I knew how many people visit this site. It was a good question and I didn't know the answer off-hand. Well, here's what I can tell you about the past 30 days...

- 660 visits (this is people , not pages viewed)
- Average of 21 'visits' per day
- 217 absolute unique visitors (how many people came to the site - people instead of visits)
- 1,337 page views

Well, there you go.

Finally, thanks to both Jill W. and Julia P. who noticed that our personal best times in the top right corner of the homepage were not up to date following our recent 10 mile race. They're all up to date now :)
