After running the weekly 5k time trial this morning my plan at the swimming pool today (we go swimming most weeks) was to time myself over 400 meters. You need to give a projected time for 400m on the entry and I wasn't so sure when I entered at the start of April and put an estimate down of 12 minutes - which was based off of some rough timing, and nothing particularly accurate. Well, lets just say that I'll be updating that time now. I swam a pretty tough 16 lengths of the 25 meter pool today in 8 minutes 18 seconds. I'm really pleased with this and am now going to request to update my time to be 8:30. The trouble is that on the day as soon as I finish swimming I have to go for a long(ish) bike ride and then a 5k run. I'm sure it'll be alright on the day.
