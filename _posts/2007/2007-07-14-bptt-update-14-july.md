Sharon and I are racing in the [Elmbridge 10k](http://www.elmbridgeroadrunners.co.uk/pages/10k07.html) on Sunday so today was an "easy" run at the Bushy Park Time Trial (BPTT). I finished in 20:09 (for info, the last time I ran "slower" was on 19 May, a day before the Bognor Regis 10k race). Sharon finished in 30:30 after a nice pootle, running 3k with friends - who later left her for dust!

After the run we enjoyed coffee and hot-chocolate at the local Cafe Nero, then it was off to the local swimming pool for (quite) a few lengths to loosen the muscles before Sunday's race, no doubt there will be more tomorrow...
