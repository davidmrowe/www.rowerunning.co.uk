After the post about [Kieren's pacing at Berlin](/?p=187) this past weekend I've got one better for you.... Heather - an experienced marathon runner who also ran at Berlin clocked the following splits....

> 5km\_\_00:27:49 10km\_00:55:20/00:27:32 15km\_01:22:23/00:27:03 20km\_01:49:38/00:27:16 25km\_02:17:04/00:27:26 30km\_02:44:54/00:27:51 35km\_03:11:48/00:26:54 40km\_03:39:34/00:27:46

Only 11 seconds difference between the first and second half. Great work.
