This past weekend the Sweatshop Surrey Cross Country League held the last race of their 2006-2007 series in Richmond Park, which is only a few miles from where we live. There were a number of races held, starting with the Ladies race at 12:15, and then finishing with the Division 1 Mens race at 15:00. Sharon and I went along to support friends running for both The Stragglers and Ranelagh running clubs and had a great time.

This was the first time I'd been to a XC event (I'd only recently seen one on TV for the first time a few weeks ago) and it was a very impressive sight. Sharon has said that she wants to get a pair of spikes and take part next year, which will be really cool. Coming straight from the BPTT race in Bushy Park in the morning, I was armed with my camera and took over 450 photos, so feel free to have a look at them over at [davidrowe.co.uk/photos/](http://davidrowe.co.uk/photos/).
