This week I (David) have been struggling with an injury. My right knee has been playing up for a few weeks now and it has deteriorated over the past week or so. I've seen a physio today and I just need to do more exercises to strengthen my knee - thankfully there doesn't look to be any real damage which is good. I've only run once this past week - a slow 5 miles on Wednesday - so was looking forward to running this morning (for info, my normal weekly mileage is currently between 35 and 40 miles). I had planned to take it easy but that idea went out of the window after I got a good start (for a change!). I ended up with my second best time at Bushy Park and finished in 18:28. I'm very happy with this.

Sharon once again ran like a little whippet and finished in 26:04, beating her previous Bushy Park personal best by 24 seconds.

Today was the final time trial of the 2007 "season" as next week is the third anniversary of this superb free (yes free) superbly organised weekly 5k race. Sharon and I have run almost all of the races over the past twelve months - including Christmas and New Years Day and its good to get to this point in one piece. Overall in the points Sharon has finished 7th, and David 2nd overall. This is a great achievement and we're looking forward to the prize giving next Saturday.
