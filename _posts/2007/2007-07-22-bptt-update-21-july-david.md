Just a quick one for me this week. I wanted to run sub-19 minutes, and came in at 18:54. I'm happy with that. I ran much of the race/time-trial on my own and there were only three people in the 20 seconds behind me. Looking ahead there was one chap who finished five seconds ahead. 334 runners finished and this was my 50th Bushy Park Time Trial. It was a lonely run.

Sharon will post her story of Saturday's time trial later...
