![20071110-rptt.jpg](/images/2007/20071110-rptt.jpg)No real news from the world of time trials today. Sharon and I both headed to Richmond Park. Sharon was helping as official time-keeper, and [I took a few photos](http://www.parkrun.com/Default.aspx?tabid=237). Sharon wasn't running this morning as she was taking part in a Surrey League cross country race at lunchtime, and I'm recovering from a calf-strain. I was really looking forward to running the cross country mens race but it was wise to give it a rest. I'll be back running in the next couple of days.

The photo shows Marc (on the lead bike) shortly after the start, being followed by the pack!
