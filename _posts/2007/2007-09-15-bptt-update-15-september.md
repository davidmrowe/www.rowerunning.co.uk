Over recent weeks England has had a few outbreaks of [foot-and-mouth disease](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6930899.stm), and the current outbreak is closer to home. Although outside of the "Protection Zone" (unfortunately Windsor Great Park is not, which caused the cancellation of this years Windsor Half Marathon - due to be held in a few weeks time), Bushy Park is part of the "Surveillance Zone" which although means that we're able to still run the Bushy Park Time Trial on a Saturday - we're hoping the situation doesn't force us to stop running. Of course, the situation with farmers up and down the country is just a touch more important than 400-odd crazy runners getting up early on a Saturday....anyway, back to business...

This morning the weather was beautiful for running, there were deer-a-plenty roaming around in the park and I was raring to go for a good time. I've been thinking about running hard for a good few days and thankfully conditions were ideal. Anyway, to cut a long story short I had a cracking race - I spent most of it running neck and neck with Sean P. (a fellow club runner) and Mark G. I didn't look at my watch once during the race and ran hard throughout. In the final straight Sean edged ahead and I managed to creep in front of Mark and also get past a couple of other runners who were ahead of me.

As I neared the finishing line I could hear a few cheers from the helpers and supporters and as I crossed the line I found out I'd knocked my old personal best time at BPTT out of the ballpark by almost 30 seconds - today's time was 18:05 (16th out of 438 finishers). Awesome.

OK, over 5k my personal best prior to this was 18:15 (from the Belgrave 5 road race) but on the Bushy Park course it was 18:33. Either way I've got another PB and that's all that matters. The best thing about this is that I know I could have pushed harder so going sub-18 minutes is on the cards - just when I don't yet know.

As for Sharon, she equaled her personal best time of 26:28. Superb.
