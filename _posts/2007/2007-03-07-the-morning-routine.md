A couple of years ago we got a [projector alarm clock](http://www.prezzybox.com/products/index.aspx?pid=2166) for the bedroom. You know, the ones that project the time onto the ceiling/wall all the time. The initial novelty was that when you woke up in the morning I knew exactly what times I had woken up in the night, to the minute!

As well as telling the time, which is a key feature of a clock, it is now part of the morning routine...

- Alarm goes off
- Find pulse
- Wait for "minute" to change on the ceiling
- Count heart beats for 60 seconds (till the time changes!)
- Compare and contrast

And thus, a new day begins... I've had a strange cold type thing for a couple of days and this possibly explains my above normal resting heart rate at the moment. Oh, expect more heart rate comments in a few weeks when my copy of a [heart rate training book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0915297256/002-6811160-5761605) arrives. In the meantime I'll keep reading the [heart rate thread over at Fetch](http://fetcheveryone.com/viewtopic.php?id=3882).
