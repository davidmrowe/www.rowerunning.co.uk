Sharon and I decided to go for a flat course and easy-ish run this morning over at Bushy Park, where we've not run for a few weeks.

Shortly after the start it began raining, and it got heavier as time went on. I finished 34th (out of 287) in 20:10, and Sharon in 29:34. We then went into Teddington for coffee (well, I had a hot chocolate) and followed that up with a swim at the local pool then lunch in a cafe.

Why were we having an easy run you ask? You'll have to wait and see.
