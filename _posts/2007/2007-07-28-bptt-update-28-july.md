After [racing only a few hours previously on Friday night](/?p=140) on the other side of Bushy Park this wasn't a day for setting personal best times, but funnily enough we got pretty close. I pushed pretty hard and finished in 19:03 (29 seconds off of his best) but Sharon finished in 28:40, only four seconds off of her best time. I can see another PB for Sharon coming in the not too distant future.
