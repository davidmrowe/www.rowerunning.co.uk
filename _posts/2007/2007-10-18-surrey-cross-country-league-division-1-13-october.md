![2007-10-13-cross_country_sign.jpg](/images/2007/2007-10-13-cross_country_sign.jpg)On Saturday Sharon and I lent our support to the Ranelagh Harriers teams that were competing in division one of the Surrey league cross country championships. The first race was for the women (and girls) in Esher, and the second race (for the men) was at Wimbledon Common.In the [overall results](http://www.ranelagh-harriers.com/results/071013fc.html), Ranelagh had three ladies finish in the top ten and this helped secure first team overall (with the 'B' and 'C' teams finishing in 15th and 31st). Our second claim running club (The Stragglers) were also competing in division 1 and we cheered them on to a 4th place team result). Sharon and I headed about 1k into the course to grab a vantage point half way up a rather horrible hill and armed with my camera I was able to get a selection of photos ([ladies](http://rowephoto.co.uk/photos/72157602449875913/), [girls](http://rowephoto.co.uk/photos/72157602475620618/)) which can be found at rowephoto.co.uk.

Over what looked like a much flatter course members of the Thames Hare & Hounds running club came in the top two positions. The first Ranelagh finisher was in 13th place but with a solid performance from the 'A' team we finished [third team](http://www.ranelagh-harriers.com/results/071013mc.html) overall. [More photos can be found at our photography website](http://rowephoto.co.uk/photos/72157602476902990/).

The next race is in early November and both Sharon and I hope to run for our club in these races.
