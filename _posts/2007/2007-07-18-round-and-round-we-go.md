![20070718-track_session.jpg](/images/2007/20070718-track_session.jpg)This evening I went down to the running track at [St. Mary's Richmond Athletic Club](http://www.smrac.org.uk/) for a training session. I've been to the track at St. Mary's a few times before to take photos at athletic events but tonight was the first time I'd ever run round the thing.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hard work, and I found it surprising how long a lap really is (er, 400 metres!). I ran round it many times, and look forward to doing it again.
