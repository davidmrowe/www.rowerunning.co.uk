*Brentford, Chiswick and Isleworth Times*

The local papers normally print the results and a photo from the weekly Bushy Park Time Trial and this week is no exception. The only reason why I mention it here is that one of the photos that I took on Saturday (after running the race myself) was used this week. Here is a [scan of this weeks issue](/images/2007/brentford-chiswick-and-isle.jpg) of the Brentford, Chiswick and Isleworth Times showing a photo of friend Charlie Burt who's running the 2007 London Marathon for the Shooting Stars Childrens Hospice.

The same photo also made it into the Richmond Informer newspaper.

Some other photos I took back in December also made it into the local paper, but I forgot to post a scan here (oh, and my name wasn't printed, so you wouldn't believe me anyway!).
