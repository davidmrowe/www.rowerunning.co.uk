Another week..... over 400 runners completed the 5k course this morning in lovely running conditions. I (David) was planning on taking it easy(ish) and ended up running only 15 seconds outside of my best time (I finished in 18:48 which I'm really happy with), but Sharon once again threw down the gauntlet and got another personal best, this time by 39 seconds giving her a Bushy Park Time Trial time of 26:28 and a finishing position of 266th.
