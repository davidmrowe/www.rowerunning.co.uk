After this mornings BPTT, I cycled off for a physio appointment near Kingston, then headed into Richmond Park to take a few photos of the inter-club cross-country race organised by Ranelagh Harriers. It was extremely muddy but it was good to be on my bike as it made it much easier to get to where I wanted - which was right by the pen-ponds in the park. I knew this would be a good spot after going down there during the cross country league a few weeks back and today did not disappoint. [Here's one](http://davidrowe.co.uk/photos/72157594567404929/408910740) of the photos that shows how big some of the puddles were and the full set can be [found here](http://davidrowe.co.uk/photos/72157594567404929/).
