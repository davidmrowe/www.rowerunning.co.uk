OK, I wasn't racing hard this week. My ankle has been giving me grief for about two months and all of a sudden last Friday I woke up and it was better - much to my delight. However, following my race last weekend in Bognor, my right foot is now \*really\* sore, so it was touch and go as to whether I was going to run yesterday or not. In fact, I was planning my "drop-out" point should it get too much. Anyway, long story short, I didn't drop out and running fairly gently down the finishing straight, with a big gap between me and the woman in front so there wasn't much need for a storming finish. Until that was I heard a little stampede behind me.

I didn't know whether or not it was a woman behind me, so decided to increase my effort in case I was about to lose out a valuable place or two. As it transpired, it was three little men - but I didn't know that until the end!! It was quite a sudden increase in pace...note the determined look on my face :)

...and there you have it...

Thanks to Angela for the photos. I hope it made you laugh whilst you were taking them!
