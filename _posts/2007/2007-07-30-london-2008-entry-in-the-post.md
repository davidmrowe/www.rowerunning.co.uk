One of the first entries on this site was entitled [London 2007 entry in the post](/?p=4), and it's time to do it again. Last year I didn't get a place in the ballot to run in the London Marathon and wasn't keen on getting a charitable place (partly because of all the work involved in raising the money, which isn't easy).

I have today completed the entry form and I'll find out if I've made it through the ballot in November/early-December.

If I get into London 2008 then I'm going to seriously get behind my training (unlike many others - [read my marathon "rant"](/?p=72) for more of my thoughts!) and go for a time somewhere close to 3 hours. With lots of training (i.e., not just starting in January) this is possible so lets just see what happens with my entry.

I'll post an update sometime in November/early-December with how I got on with the ballot.
