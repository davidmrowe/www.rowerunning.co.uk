Thames Turbo Triathlon Club have just [uploaded the starting order](http://www.thamesturbo.co.uk/memberforum/viewtopic.php?t=2605) for the triathlon I've entered this coming (public holiday) Monday. I'm race number 36, which with the first swimmer starting at 7am I won't have to wait around too long before setting off. Others that I know taking part are "team-mate" Kirsty (123), Suze (113), and Roger (116).

Wish me luck...!
