For myself (David) today was an easy run as I was racing proper in the afternoon. I took it steady, tried to keep my heart rate under 160 throughout and finished the 5km in a time of 20:34. There was a record number of finishers today - 439 - and this will no doubt be a lot bigger in a few weeks time when the Bushy Park Time Trial celebrates its 3rd birthday on 6 October.

Sharon had a good run today and finished in 26:38, which is 10 seconds off of her personal best.
