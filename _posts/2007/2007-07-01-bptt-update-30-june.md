We're back at BPTT and it decided to rain most of the way round during this weeks 5k time trial. The weather was actually ideal (rain is a good thing) and there was little wind.

I hoped to run just under 19 minutes and came home in 17th place (my second best ever finishing time) with a time of 18:51. I ran fairly strongly, but there was certainly more in me if I had needed it. After creeping past I think one person on the final straight I pushed on to maintain my position and not go for a faster time.

Sharon finished in 270th place with a time of 30:21. There were 304 finishers.

In other news, after [my comment about Danny not running fast enough](/?p=113) a couple of weeks ago, he ended up winning the Bushy Park Time Trial on his 51st attempt. Well done to you.
