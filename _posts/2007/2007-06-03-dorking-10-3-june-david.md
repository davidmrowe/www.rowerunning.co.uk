![](/images/2007/527815641_0e9009dbb5_m.jpg)Extremely warm weather awaited the competitors taking part in the [Dorking 10](http://www.dmvac.org.uk/dorking10/) (mile) road running race today (Sunday). After a busy day on Saturday (BPTT - which I ran harder than I should have), and then a visit to the Epsom Derby to [celebrate Kirsty's birthday](http://www.sharonrowe.co.uk/photos/2007/72157600300932139/), we awoke bright and early (6:15am) and got ourselves ready. The usual checklist was ticked off (sports drink, running number, club vests, watches, bananas, suncream, more suncream) and away we went.

The [start of the race in Brockham village](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=106227624638591124115.00000112f209c41a347f5) was extremely picturesque and this wasn't limited to just the start. Around just about every corner was a cracking view - real picture postcard potential all the way round. OK, the weather certainly helped but I really enjoyed running this course.

There were a few hills to be tackled, but nothing too taxing if you ran steady and paced yourself - especially important in the heat. The roads were really quiet, although I did have to slow down a bit at one point when following a car going up a hill. Apart from that one incident cars were not a problem in the slightest.

I wasn't particularly geared up for this race, and had no expectations. My previous personal best over 10 miles was 67:36 at the [Thames Towpath 10](/?p=65) in mid April. As I knew today's was a hilly course I'd said to myself that 69:59 would be excellent and I'd be very happy to come in under 75 minutes.

I won't talk much about the race but let's just said I ran fairly hard, but not excessively, as I had no idea what hill was around the next corner. The only tough one to be honest was between between 8 and 9 miles, which understandably was my slowest mile split. I kept strong up this one and managed to creep past one or two runners.

My final finishing time was 68:29, and position wise I was 83rd out of 600 finishers. My watch had the time down as a few seconds quicker (as it took a few seconds to get over the start line). I'm really happy with this especially off of the back of a sub 19 minute 5k the previous day. I was also fourth [Ranelagh Harrier finisher](http://www.ranelagh-harriers.com/results/070603.html) which I'm extremely pleased about, as we had 18 of us from the club running.

For those interested in the stats (probably just Kieren ;), my average heart rate was 170bpm (maximum 185), and my mile splits were as follows: (1)6:32, (2)6:46, (3)6:48, (4)6:52, (5)7:00, (6)6:55, (7)6:47, (8)7:03, (9)7:07, (10)6:36. This was an average pace of 6 minutes 51 per mile.

Comparing to the (flat) Towpath 10 a few weeks ago I was about 50 seconds slower today. Oh, and my heart rate averaged at 174bpm back then. I know I could have pushed harder but that was never my intention today. All I wanted to do was run well and I believe I did.

Sharon will probably post more later about her run but for now I'll leave you with this...
