Sunny weather brought over 350 along to Bushy Park for the 153rd running of the Bushy Park Time Trial. Although a bit of a breeze was in the air, both Sharon and I ran hard and it paid off. I managed a small personal best of.....one second, bringing my 5k best time down to 18:33.

On the other hand, Sharon once again picked up her old personal best and kicked it out of the ball-park. Over 70 seconds quicker than her previous time she finished in 27:22. Superb.
