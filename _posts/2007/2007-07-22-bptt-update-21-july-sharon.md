So after my session with the physio on Friday, I had no hip pain - but my back was a tad sore from being crunched! However, it was the best I have felt physically since about February when all the niggly little injuries started (sore ankle tendon, hip, chipped cuboid...blah blah!).

I was on the start line and jokingly said to Kirsty that I felt "focussed". I wasn't wrong! I went off and tried to keep someone in my sights who normally whizzes away from me and just kept her close by. In fact, around 3.5 kms I started to catch her. It was at about 4kms in that I thought I was running well and would be on for a PB with a bit of extra effort.

I rounded the home straight corner and promptly pressed the wrong button on my new Garmin 305 (doh!)...I realised though after a few seconds and started it again. As I was running down Chestnut Avenue, Hollywood was there cheering me on and shouting, "Go on, you're on for it, sub-29!". He wasn't wrong. I crossed the line in 28:36 (another 34 seconds taken off my PB) - and I was absolutely over the moon!

That was my 13th PB at BPTT this year and I guess the aim now is to stay under 29 minutes. Possibly easier said than done...but hopefully the extra training I have been doing will help.
