In addition to the regular 5k time trial at Richmond Park we played host to a "mob-match" between local triathlon clubs [Thames Turbo](http://www.thamesturbo.co.uk/) and [Ful On Tri](http://www.fulontri.com/). This took the numbers to over 140 runners - with the organisers coping brilliantly with this much larger than normal turnout.

Sharon and I knew about the event in advance to chose to help - Sharon in charge of timing and myself taking some photos. The light was not good for photos (especially with my choice of lens) but I managed to get a few reasonable shots out of it.

The final result between the two triathlon clubs ended with Ful On Tri being the clear winners. A [handful of photos](http://www.rowephoto.co.uk/photos/72157603474056325/) can be found at our photography site and my 'full set' can be seen at the [RPTT website](http://richmond.parkrun.com).

Following the time trial a large group of us went to the lovely cafe at Pembroke Lodge, and then Sharon and I went for a run in the park - albeit running in different directions!
