Another week, another BPTT! Had a good run today, and spent almost all the race in with a "pack" of runners - don't you just love the sound of someone breathing heavily right behind you to make you pick up the pace a bit! The ground was once again _lovely_ and soft (!!) although it didn't show from my time - 8 seconds up on last week. I finished in 40th place (out of 279 finishers) with a time of 19:46, my best time since Christmas day last year (yes, we raced on Christmas day!) which was just when my hip problems began (I got 19:27 that day - oh I long to get back there!).

Sharon's run wasn't brill but she got round in a very respectable time (31:43).

Finally, here's a [quick shot of me near the finish](http://www.parkrun.com/Portals/0/UltraPhotoGallery/641/56/large/DSC_2612.JPG) - looks like my eyes are closed - they probably are!
