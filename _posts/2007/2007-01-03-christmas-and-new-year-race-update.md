Quick update - Over the Christmas holiday period I ran five races - four BPTT's and also the Cabbage Patch 4 Mile race on Boxing Day. The four-miler was really good fun and nice to be out on the road for a race (compared with the park). I came 8th out of 64 finishers with a time of 24:40.

Sharon ran four BPTT's and she is currently 11th in the overall 2007 Womens league table.

I'm nursing a hip problem at present, and am seeing a sports physio for it and am significantly reducing my running at the moment for a few weeks.
