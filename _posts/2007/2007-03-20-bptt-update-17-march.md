...well, there isn't one. Sharon and I had a weekend away from Bushy Park. I've been at each of the last 26 or so races at Bushy Park - including the Christmas and New Years Day races so Saturday morning at 9am felt kinda strange. Not too strange as not to allow us to enjoy a "Full English" breakfast at the B&B we were staying at in [Cornwall for the weekend](http://www.sharonrowe.co.uk/photos/2007/72157600010829906/) though :)
