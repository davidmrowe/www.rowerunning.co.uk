After a lot of overnight fog it was cold in Richmond Park this morning - and this was very noticeable with the amount of ice on the paths - very slippery indeed! Sharon volunteered to help today whilst I chose to run (my third time running RPTT since it started ten weeks ago).

There was a strong field today with the winning time being 16:42, which is 8 seconds outside of the course record - very impressive considering the conditions. I had to be slightly conservative in places with my running, opting to stay away from the (ice-rink) tarmac path and keeping to the grass during the the first half of the course. For the second half I was able to stay on the path (just) and fought my way to finish in 10th place overall with a time of 19:11. I found it hard going this morning (nobody ever said 5k was easy) and am fairly happy with the time. I would have preferred a sub-19 time but I'll save that for another day.

Following the run it was off to the cafe for breakfast and then I cycled to the local pool for a swim. Another busy Saturday...
