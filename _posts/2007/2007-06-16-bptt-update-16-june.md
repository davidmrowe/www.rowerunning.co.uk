Well, what can we say. There isn't a BPTT update this week as we were not around to run it today. Looking at the results the turnout was low (just over 300), and if Danny had found more and ran faster he could have come second \*grin\*. Maybe next week eh?

I did however wear my BPTT t-shirt today with pride when I went out for a mountain bike ride with Sharon. Let's just say the weather is nicer where we are.
