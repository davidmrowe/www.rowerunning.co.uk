So, the Bushy Park Time Trial (BPTT) 2007 season is well under way and because of my (crazy) consistency of going every week and doing pretty well, as of 1st January [I am currently top of the league](http://www.bptt.net/snippets/BPTT/summaries/pointsSummary2007M.html).

The points system is described as follows...

> After each race we separate the men & women into their own categories. For each category, starting at 250 for the first runner to finish we allocate a score to each finisher, reducing the score by one point until one point. Thereafter everyone gets one point.
> 
> So, if you were the 15th finisher in your category you scored 236 points. If you were the 250th finisher in your category you score one point.

I've been in the top 5 for a few weeks now and just clinched the top spot when the chap in first place was not there on New Years Day. He's clearly a much faster runner than I am (by about a minute or so over 5k) but my weekly consistency (I'm the only person who's completed all 15 races so far) has got me where I am.

Over the coming weeks and months I expect to drop from the top spot and fall down a few places - but whilst I'm here I'll enjoy it!
