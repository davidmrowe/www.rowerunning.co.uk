A crisp cold morning today - absolutely perfect running weather in my opinion, although the body does have to work a little harder in this kind of weather. I (David) had a good run today and managed 20:25 which I was happy with. My hip seems to be getting just slightly better by the day which is a good thing.

Sunday I'm doing a 10k (with Sharon) and I don't plan to push too hard. I'll be wearing some recently acquired Adidas shoes after being told that the shoes I'd been wearing recently weren't right for me (maybe that's partly why my hip's screwed) and we'll see how I get on. More on Sunday...
