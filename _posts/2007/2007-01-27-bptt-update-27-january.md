No rain today, in fact the ground was fairly firm under foot - maybe that explains yet another PB from me :) That makes 9 PB's in 15 races so far this year and the best bit is I am into yet another "new minute" as Kirsty (who got a PB today too, well done Miss B) called it a couple of weeks back. When I did my first BPTT back in September I finished in 34:55 and today I finished in 30:54 - so I have shaved off 4:01 in about 4 months. My aim is to get to 29:59 by my birthday in early April but that feels a loooong way off. I really enjoyed it today and as I am getting faster I get to run close to other people too and have the odd finishing line "sprint" race with someone, which is cool. Unfortunately, despite recording my best time, I think I had my worst finish position thanks to the ever-increasing numbers on the start line. I am wondering what will be done...

David had a good run too, his best in a few weeks and he is pretty pleased I think. He has an MRI scan and x-ray of his hip on Monday, so no doubt will post an update then - fingers crossed everyone please for it being nothing serious and nothing which stops him running.
