![20071201-rptt-ben_osborn.jpg](/images/2007/20071201-rptt-ben_osborn.jpg)With both Sharon and I running later in the day we chose to help out at the Richmond Park Time Trial this morning. Sharon was helping at the finish and I took a few photos - all of which will soon be at the [RPTT website](http://richmond.parkrun.com).

The winner was Ben Osborn (pictured) from [The Stragglers](http://www.stragglers.org) in a time of 17:56. There were 69 finishers, which was the most entries so far in the race's seven week history.
