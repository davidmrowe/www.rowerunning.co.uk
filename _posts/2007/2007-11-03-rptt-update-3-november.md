[![2007-11-03-richmond_park.jpg](/images/2007/2007-11-03-richmond_park.jpg)](http://rowephoto.co.uk/photos/72157602883366040/)Sharon and I chose to help today at the Richmond Park Time Trial as we were running a cross country race later in the day and wanted to preserve our energy for that!

Instead, Sharon was in charge of timing whilst I was the 'official' photographer - and I really enjoyed it as the autumnal weather was absolutely beautiful. My full set of photos is at the [RPTT website](http://www.parkrun.com/Default.aspx?tabid=237), and a select few (available in full resolution) can be found at [rowephoto.co.uk](http://rowephoto.co.uk/photos/72157602883366040/).
