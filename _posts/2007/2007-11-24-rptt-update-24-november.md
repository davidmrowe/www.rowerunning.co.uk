Not much of an update from the [parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com) empire today... Sharon's away for a few days with some friends and I was not running as I was taking park in a cross country race in the afternoon. So rather than have a lie-in on a crisp Saturday morning I cycled the 3 miles to the park and cycled round the course with the lead bike. After becoming frozen from the ride it was off to the cafe for a lovely hot drink to thaw out. Then it was a cycle home. So, overall about 10 miles or so on the bike today.
