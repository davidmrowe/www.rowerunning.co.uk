[![2007-05-02-rosenheim_league.jpg](/images/2007/2007-05-02-rosenheim_league.jpg)](http://davidrowe.co.uk/photos/72157600170214119/ "2007-05-02-rosenheim_league.jpg")After getting home from work on Wednesday evening I jumped in the car and headed over to the [Kingsmeadow Athletics Centre](http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=kingston) in Kingston upon Thames to watch the first of 2007's Rosenheim League athletics events.

They're very low key - you can just turn up and run - but I wasn't ready for my track debut yet - although it has been recommended to me as a way of getting some great speed training done.

I just went along to soak up the atmosphere and capture a few photos. Earlier on it was better as the sun hadn't set but once the sun went down my choice of camera lenses was reduced to one and I had to make do with that. Feel free to [browse the pictures over at davidrowe.co.uk](http://davidrowe.co.uk/photos/72157600170214119/).

On Saturday afternoon I'm going to watch the Southerns Mens League event at [St. Mary's](http://www.smrac.org.uk/fixtures2007.html) in Teddington so expect more athletics photos to appear online over the coming weeks and months.
