Fresh back from a weeks holiday (er, training) it was back to Bushy Park for the weekly 5k time trial. I (David) was not planning to push it hard as I'd felt rotten all day on Friday and had a temperature. An early night and some paracetamol helped no-end. Sharon also hadn't been feeling too great over the past few days so we weren't expecting anything special today.

Of the 381 finishers, I finished in 39th place with a time of 19:31 (just under a minute off of my best time). Sharon finished 252nd with a time of 27:07 - a personal best on this course of 15 seconds! Superb.

There's only 5 more time trials in this current 2006-2007 points season where I am currently in second place, and Sharon is in seventh. Once these races are over we can try some of the other time trials, especially the newly announced [Richmond Park Time Trial](http://www.parkrun.com/Default.aspx?tabid=231) that starts on 13 October.
