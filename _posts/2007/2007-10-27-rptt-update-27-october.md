Sharon and I headed to Richmond Park this morning (Saturday) to run the second official [Richmond Park Time Trial](http://richmond.parkrun.com) (RPTT) 5k race. Weather was once again ideal although Sharon wasn't feeling particularly up for it and I had run rather hard yesterday (more on that in another post soon!).

After last weeks top two positions were taken by members of [Ranelagh Harriers](http://www.ranelagh-harriers.com) this week it was dominated by members of [The Stragglers](http://www.stragglers.org) - who came home with the first three positions. Ranelagh (our 'first claim' running club) took positions four and five, and I ran well enough to secure fourth place with a time of 18:59 (for info last week my time was 18:42).

Sharon ran the course in a time of 27:58 (last week her time was 28:27). There were 51 runners taking part this week.
