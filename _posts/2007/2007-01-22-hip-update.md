I saw a specialist this morning. I'm now awaiting a call to schedule an x-ray and MRI scan that will hopefully reveal a bit more about why I've got this hip pain. He said I can still run provided its not massive amounts and doesn't cause things to get worse.

I'm currently doing about 8 miles each week at present, 3 on Saturday (BPTT), and 5 slow miles on a Sunday. I'll also try and get a gym session in during the week to maintain at least some level of fitness.
