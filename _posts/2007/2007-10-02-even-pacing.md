In recent races I've been pretty consistent with my pacing - something that I'm proud of. Well, at the start of August my friend Kieren posted on his blog about how [his pacing has not been quite as he'd hoped](http://kieren.demon.co.uk/2007/08/04/blew-up-at-bushy-park/) and how my "pacing is excellent and consistent".

Well, its only fair to repay the complement (when its well deserved) and let you know about the post at his blog about [his experience at the Berlin Marathon this past weekend](http://kieren.demon.co.uk/2007/10/02/berlin-marathon-2007/). His pacing was brilliant, especially taking into consideration his 5 (yes, five!) toilet stops in the first half. He was aiming for a time of around 3:42 (8.5 minute mile pace) and finished in a time of 3:37. Check out the pacing details in his blog post for his 5k split times.

Well done Kieren.
