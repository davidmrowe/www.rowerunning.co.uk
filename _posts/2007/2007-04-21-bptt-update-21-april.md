371 runners finished today's [Bushy Park Time Trial](http://www.parkrun.com/Default.aspx?tabid=191), almost matching the 378 who completed it on its second anniversary back in October 2007. I (David) had no plans to run hard today because of a dodgy left calf but anyone who knows me knows that I find it very hard not to race at BPTT.

Well, I ended up getting another personal best, this time by 8 seconds, making my 5k time 18:40. This is the second time under 19 minutes, and it now seems clear that I can comfortably (in a sense!) run sub-19 minutes. I had a great run, found it not quite as tough as my 18:48 a couple of weeks ago - which has got to be a good thing. One thing that I really noticed today was that I spent about 3k's running within about one foot of fellow runner Darren W right beside me, and we didn't once say a word. We chatted comfortably before the start and as soon as we hear the GOOOO! then you're in full-on race mode.

Sharon here....I had a fab run today, felt good and had a bit of a race with a few women around me. Managed 29.10 - which is a PB of 45 seconds. I am really pleased as it feels like 28 minutes something is in reach now. I was grinning like mad after I finished :)

Tomorrow, Sunday is the day of the London Marathon. We've got friends running in it this year and cannot wait to cheer them on - and with the weather forecast looking like its going to [match the previous record temperature](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6579629.stm) of 21c, then they're going to need all the support they can get. Expect more marathon updates in the next couple of days.
