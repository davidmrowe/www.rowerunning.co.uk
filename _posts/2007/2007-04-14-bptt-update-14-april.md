Glorious sunshine once again at Bushy Park and just under 350 people took part in this, the 137th running of the [Bushy Park Time Trial](http://www.parkrun.com/bptt_home.aspx). Sharon and I are both taking part in a 10 mile race tomorrow so we took it easier (only just) than usual to preserve energy. I had a good run and sailed home in 19:38, with Sharon coming in at 31:12.

We then went for coffee and a panini, and then headed to Teddington pool for a swim. A fish-finger sandwich and cake (for a late lunch) followed then it was off to bet on the Grand National horse race. None of my horses finished well (if they finished at all) and I ended up 8 quid down. Never mind.

Now its off for a dinner of pasta in preparation for tomorrow. Its going to be a hot one...
