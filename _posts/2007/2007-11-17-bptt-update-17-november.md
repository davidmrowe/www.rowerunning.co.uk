Sharon and I haven't been to the Bushy Park Time Trial since [mid-October](/?p=193) (we've been going to the Richmond Park race instead) but today we wanted an easy, flat 5k to act as a bit of gentle preparation for a 10k that we're running on Sunday. It was strange to be back at Bushy Park after running it just about every single week for a year and then not going for five weeks. It didn't seem like anyone missed us though :(

I ran round in 19:11 (a little quicker than my planned 20 minutes) and Sharon finished in 28:37.

Following the run I went for a swim and Sharon went for a haircut. Different kind of race preparation eh!
