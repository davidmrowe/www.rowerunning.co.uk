Local runner, Bushy Park Time Trial winner, European Cross Country Champion and Britain's second fastest ever 5km runner (an amazing 13:09.40) popped into the [adiRun](http://www.sweatshop.co.uk/adiRuns/) London Marathon training session (I'm helping out on Sunday mornings) held in Teddington on Sunday 25th February where he and David shared running tips (er, or something like that!). Some photos are over at [Sharon's gallery](http://www.sharonrowe.co.uk/photos/2007/72157594555861427/).
