![20080126-rptt-karen.jpg](/images/2008/20080126-rptt-karen.jpg)Sharon and I helped out at Richmond Park on Saturday morning. It wasn't any ordinary day at RPTT - it was the morning of Karen (the race directors wedding. There was bubbly, balloons, and people dressed up for the occasion.

Following the race it was off for a hot drink at the Pembroke Lodge cafe and then we headed to the railway station for a real running adventure.... more to follow later....
