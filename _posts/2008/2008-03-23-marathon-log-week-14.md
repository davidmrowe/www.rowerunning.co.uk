**Week 14 (w/c 17 March)** - This week I have run a total of zero miles. Yup, none whatsoever. I wanted to give my calf as good a chance as possible to start healing (see [week 13's log](/?p=296) for more info) and the plan was to try and jog round Bushy Park Time Trial this morning. I was looking forward to putting my running shoes on the the first time in just over a week. After arriving at the park I did a short jog of about 1km with Sharon and things just didn't feel right. I was not ready to risk further injury by running/jogging the 5k time trial so I chose not to.

My ideal plan for this week was to jog round [time trial](http://bushy.parkrun.com) - see that things were a lot better and then do a much longer slow run on Monday. Well, after this mornings failed attempt at even a worthwhile jog any long running is out of the question. I just don't want to make things worse.

After watching BPTT (boy it was windy out there for the runners, and we graced with the presence of [Hayley Yelling](http://athleticsdata.com/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=1810), who is in final preparations for the IAAF World Cross Country Championships being held in Edinburgh next weekend) I headed for a swim and then after lunch off to a physio appointment.

Although things are certainly improving from a week ago, I'm clearly not ready to start running again, and with the prospect of running 26.2 miles in 15 days time things are not looking good.

To this end I have decided that I will no longer be running the [Bungay marathon](http://www.bungay-marathon.co.uk/) on 6 April. As things are this was to be honest a fairly easy decision to make. I want my first marathon to be 1) enjoyable, and 2) a reasonable time. Both of these will not happen if I chose to run.

Now, I have to think ahead and what my plans are for the coming months. First priority (apart from getting back to fitness) is a 10k in the middle of May. Following that an (almost) half-ironman distance triathlon in early June.

Over the next two weeks I plan to step up my swimming/cycling/gym training to maintain fitness and prepare for the triathlon in June.

However, in 15 days time Sharon and I will be at the start line in Bungay to cheer and support our friend Kirsty on, and she's gonna have to run for me too. No pressure then!

Total mileage: 0.
