This past weekend (5,6th April) those who are running the London Marathon this coming weekend will have been in full "taper" mode and hopefully having a pleasant final long(ish) run - and at the same time maybe trying to enjoy the snow that fell in much of the UK.

On Sunday morning the [Steyning Triathlon](http://www.rawenergypursuits.co.uk/) was held in Horsham, West Sussex and as the morning went on, the weather closed in. The official photos have been posted over at [Antbliss.com](http://antbliss.thirdlight.com/index.tlx?albumid=141342) but here's a shot I picked up via [TriTalk](http://www.tritalk.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=42274) and [Rightzone](http://www.rightzone.co.uk/) that I just had to post here as well!

This was the bike transition area - fancy a 36km bike ride and 8km run in this weather? Don't worry - I didn't take part in this race - however I was somewhere probably just as cold (more on that later).

Finally to those running in London - do not fear - the [weather forecast for Sunday is looking pretty good](http://scienceofsport.blogspot.com/2008/04/london-marathon-2008-weather-forecast.html).
