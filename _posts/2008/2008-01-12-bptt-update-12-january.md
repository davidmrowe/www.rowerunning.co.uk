This morning Sharon headed to Bushy Park to watch and take some photos at the weekly time trial. I was being mangled by my physio at the same time although I did manage to get back to the park to watch most of the finishers come in.

Unfortunately I missed watching the winner of today's race - our good friend Danny. This is his second win at Bushy Park so well done mate.
