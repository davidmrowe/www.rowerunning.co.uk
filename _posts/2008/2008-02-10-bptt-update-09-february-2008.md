Another Saturday dawns...and today the weather was absolutely beautiful. Arriving at Bushy Park I went for a 1k warm-up and it was flippin' freezing. I rushed back to the car and got some gloves on. Just after 9am over 300 runners started and headed down the long 1k grass straight as part of the new (permanent) clockwise course direction. I was taking it a little easier as I'm running a 10k on Sunday and ran comfortably in a time of 19:17, which was 24th overall.

I followed this with a cool-down lap and then it was off to the local cafe to relax for a while before heading to Richmond Park to support Sharon in the Surrey League Cross Country race...

Oh, one thing that really deserves reporting is the fact that good friend Danny Norman won the race for the third time - and at the same time he got himself a new personal best time on the course - just over 16 and a half minutes. Over recent months he's upped his training and really been working hard and its all paying off. If you want to get quicker, there's no miracle overnight method - you just have to work hard and work sensibly. Well done.
