I've [posted here before](/?p=282) about some of the local newspaper coverage that my photos have made it into, and also about Sharon and I when we were '[featured](/?p=233)' in Runners World magazine in the January 2008 issue.

Well, after standing for hours in the pouring rain this past Monday [taking photos at the London 10,000 race](/?p=351) the photos that I took were tracked down on the internet by the editors at [Athletics Weekly](http://www.athletics-weekly.com/) who contacted me (yup, I didn't go to them), asking if they could use some in the 29 May edition that was about to go to press. I was more than happy to let them use some of the photos and I'm delighted to say that in the current issue of Athletics Weekly [there's no less than eight of my photos featured in their report of the race](/2008/05/2008-05-29-athletics_weekly_large.jpg) (which is one of the main articles this week - it's advertised on the front cover). I'm really pleased that my little photography hobby is getting some more recognition and I don't feel at all bad about getting soaked through on Monday!

On the back of this I sent a couple of photos to the local newspaper (Richmond & Twickenham Times) which got included in their report of the race, both in the physical newspaper and on their website.
