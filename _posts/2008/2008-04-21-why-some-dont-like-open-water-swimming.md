In our circle of running (and swimming) friends we've been trying to encourage Danny to give open water swimming a try. There's the freedom of being able to swim anywhere you want without the restriction of lanes - water that hasn't been peed in by half the babies and children who have been swimming before you, and the lovely non chlorinated water.

Danny believes the dangers far outweigh the benefits and to this he has sent me a photo from Saturday's lake swimming session, and I can only say I'm glad I was facing the other direction!
