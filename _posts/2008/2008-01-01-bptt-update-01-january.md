![20080101-danny_bptt.jpg](/images/2008/20080101-danny_bptt.jpg)Whilst much of the world wakes up with a New Years Day hangover the Bushy Park Time Trial takes place like clockwork (in addition to every Saturday morning they organise additional runs on Christmas and New Years day). After a quiet new years eve at home with good friends we headed to Bushy Park for the first run of the year. When I say 'we', I mean Sharon and not me. After the [race we ran a few days ago](/?p=252) I've got a slight muscle pull in my left leg so I'm resting for a few days. Sharon on the other hand represented the Rowe's at the new years run whilst I took photos.

On the new years day run the organisers encourage people to wear their new years eve party outfits - now, although we didn't party Sharon, Kirsty and Danny dressed up for the occasion - with Danny looking quite unique in a bow-tie, triathlon one-piece suit and compression-sock combo! He led for the first part of the run and then dropped back and finished in third place. Sharon had a comfortable run and finished in 28:11. In total over 175 runners took part in the new years run.
