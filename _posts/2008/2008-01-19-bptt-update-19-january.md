I needed to do a slightly longer run today (and had no plans to run the time trial) so at 8am left the house and ran for just under 6 miles - with my route ending up at the start line for the BPTT. Sharon had driven to the event and after I'd stretched and cooled down I grabbed the camera and took [photos of the race](http://parkrun.com/Default.aspx?tabid=176). I really enjoy watching the BPTT, especially the leaders coming into the finish from afar.

Sharon had a reasonable run and finished in 27:21 - 252nd out of 388 runners.

It was a windy morning and the ground was very muddy and soft - especially at the start - so much so that a number of runners managed to lose their running shoes in the mud! Tighter laces and double knots in future me thinks!
