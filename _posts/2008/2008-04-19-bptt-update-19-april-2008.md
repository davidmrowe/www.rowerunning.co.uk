Sharon's hurt her ankle and it seems that when she stops running I'm back on two feet again and thus today was my first run at the Bushy Park Time Trial since early March.

My only plan was to run comfortably, not race at all, and take it steady. I couldn't be bothered to wear my watch and chose to just listen to my body. It was breezy, fairly crowded where I was running but I still finished in 37th place with a time of 19:52. I had not expected to run sub-20 minutes today but had absolutely no idea what time I was running at, although I guess it did feel around that sort of pace.

The run didn't cause any discomfort in my calf muscle which I was really pleased about. If the weather is good on Sunday I'm planning a long bike ride followed by a run and then food - and lots of it!
