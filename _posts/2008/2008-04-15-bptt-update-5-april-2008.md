Wow, this is a really late entry. Apologies, I am rubbish at keeping up to date.

Nothing really to report today, I did the BPTT as the middle lap of my long run today. A lap before, then the time trial, then another lap. I managed to reign myself in and did my slowest time in a long time (29:31), then was dragged off for another lap by Nicola and Faye. I hadn't had a good running week, thanks to a sore left Achilles, so I was pleased to run just over 9 miles.
