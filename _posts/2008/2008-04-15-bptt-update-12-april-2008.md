Well, the big news is that there is no BPTT update for this week, as we were away in Scotland for a good friend's wedding. However, we still managed to get out for a run. There was an open invitation from the Bridegroom, Richard, but it was no real surprise when there was only the 3 of us at 7am for the run.

David was happy to complete his second run since returning to pounding the concrete. Sharon stopped after 3 miles as the hills around [Loch Ard](http://www.visitdunkeld.com/tour-loch-ard.htm) were doing her Achilles no favours! However, it was lovely to be out running in such beautiful surroundings.

9am saw us readying ourselves for a kayaking expedition on the Loch, we thought of you all lined up on the BPTT start line though...
