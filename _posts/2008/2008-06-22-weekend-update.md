Regular readers may have noticed the lack of recent weekly "BPTT" (Bushy Park Time Trial) updates - well, we're trying to make this blog more than just continuous rambling so will mention it more when interesting things happen (i.e., I get a PB - the last one was in October last year). Well, here's a quick update on my training/progress this week since last weekends Welsh Castles Relay.

OK, running down hills is tough - real tough - and it's something I'm not great at. I believe this is what's given me so much flippin' pain in my lower right leg this week. Monday/Tuesday I had a lot of trouble walking down stairs, and on Thursday morning I went for an easy jog before work - I lasted less than two minutes before I gave up. I'd caused some nasty damage down there so its time to keep off the running. To be honest I'm not suprised after a tough few weeks of racing. I'm happy to give my legs a bit of a rest - but not \*that\* much of a rest though....

Saturday morning came and I went and watched the 5k time trial at Bushy Park. The weather wasn't the best but if I'm in the local area I just have to watch a time trial on a Saturday morning. Following this (and a customary coffee in Teddington) I returned home, pumped up the tyres on my bike and set off for a long bike ride.... I've fancied the idea of cycling to my parents house before (they live on the south coast of England) and thought this would be a good day. Sharon had been invited to a BBQ at a friends so the plan was for me to cycle 60 miles, and for Sharon to go enjoy a BBQ and then drive to my parents later on. Hmn, does that sound fair?

I eventually pulled up at my parents house just over 4 hours after I left home. My actual 'active time' on the bike was 3 hours 50 (which includes a brief toilet stop) and I wasn't in great shape at the end. Its funny that two weeks before I cycled 52 miles at the Bala triathlon (which was much tougher) and didn't feel half as bad as I did on Saturday. I'm sure nutrition on the bike had a big part to play this time.

Anyway, after a bath (cold of course) and a bit of a rest it was off to the pub for a pint and then a lovely Indian takeaway meal. A great end to a tough afternoon.

Sunday morning dawned and the wind was blowing strong. I'm not sure I've mentioned it here on this blog before but I used to be a bit of a keen windsurfer. I've got a load of kit at my parents house and today I took advantage of being in the right place at the right time to go for a sail. I spent around 2.5 hours out on the water in total and had a great sail - and it was great to see that I hadn't lost too many skills after not sailing in just over a year!

Sharon took a few [photos that can be found on our personal gallery](http://sharonrowe.co.uk/photos/2008/72157605754640689/) but for readers here I leave you with one of my favourite photos from today - me getting a little 'air time'....

Whilst all this 'fun' has been going on Sharon and I have also been keeping a close eye on what's happened today (Sunday) in Nice as part of the [Ironman France](http://www.ironmanfrance.com/) race. We know a few people who were taking part in today's race and were really pleased to see good friend Stuart finish in just over 12 and a half hours (3.8km swim, 180km bike, 42.2km run). Brilliant stuff.
