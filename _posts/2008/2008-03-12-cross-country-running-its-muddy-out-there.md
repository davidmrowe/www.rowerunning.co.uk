I love cross country running, the mud, the wet, the tough terrain etc. etc. I tell you, it grows hairs on your chest - or something like that! We do a lot of cross country running in Richmond Park as part of the Ranelagh Harriers running club that Sharon and I are members of, but I think my favourite courses are currently the ones at Parliament Hill in North London, and the Wimbledon Common course that Thames Hare and Hounds club use.

On 26 January of this year the Midlands Cross Country championships were held in Royal Leamington Spa. One of the 'highlights' of the course is the infamous 'ditch'. Via a friend I came across a [video on YouTube which shows highlights from this years race](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Yru1JO2lE). If you're into running (if not, then you're not welcome on this site!), sit back, turn up the volume (the shouts from the crowd really add to the video) and enjoy...
