I spent three nights this week working in the city of [Elgin](http://www.elginscotland.org/) in the north of Scotland. The furthest north I've been before is Glasgow - and Elgin is about 130 miles higher than that. Now if it had been summer time when it doesn't get dark for very long at night I'd be able to really explore the area with some long runs after work. Unfortunately in the middle of January this isn't really possible.

On Wednesday evening I had planned to run 11 miles and and managed to fit this in quite well within the boundaries of this little city. Here you are, courtesy of my GPS device, a map of what I managed...
