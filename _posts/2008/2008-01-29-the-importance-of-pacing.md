I've mentioned before on this site about how I think racing at the correct pace is one of the most important aspects to having a good run, and setting off too quickly can often lead to all sorts of problems later on in a race (which I have experienced to an extent).

Well, at the [Osaka International Ladies Marathon](http://www.ktv.co.jp/marathon/english/index.html) this past weekend (well done btw to England's Mara Yamauchi for winning) all eyes were on Japanese runner Kayoko Fukushi who was making her debut in the marathon. She has a number of national records at shorter distances and on Sunday set off at a flying pace - so much so that she ran off alone into the distance and created a very comfortable lead - or at least it seemed. After the half-way point she started to slow and her final lap inside of stadium to the finish is something that has to be seen to be believed.

> Fukushi enters the stadium, falls flat on her face, stands up and soldiers bravely on. I timed her final 300m at 2 minutes and 21 seconds - a pace of 7:50/km! That includes two falls in the final 200m.

This quote, a link to a video of the stadium lap (well worth watching), and some interesting reading about how she ran her race can be seen at the [excellent Science Of Sport website](http://scienceofsport.blogspot.com/2008/01/sports-news-addition.html).

> What looked like being a dream debut for Kayoko Fukushi turned into a catastrophe. The Japanese record-holder at 3000m, 5000m and the half-marathon was on course for something in the low-2:20's, after passing through halfway in 1:10:32. Fukushi even had a two-minute lead at 30km but the Japanese star began to toil badly. The Asian Games 10000m champion, who had been tipped to improve on the world-leading mark of 2:22:38 was swallowed up by the pursuing group by 35km, with the next 5km split taking a painful 24:48. Fukushi clearly hit the wall, as the last 2.2km took 15:37, to finish 19th in 2:40:54.

With my first marathon coming up at the start of April this is one mistake I don't want to make (oh, and don't worry, I won't be trying to run it at 2 hour 20 pace!).
