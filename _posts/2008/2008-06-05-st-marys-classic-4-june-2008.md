Sharon, Danny and myself went along to watch the racing and it was fantastic. The track at St. Mary's is really good for spectating and there were a few hundred people milling about eating, drinking and watching the top class athletes racing in events from the 200m through to 3000m steeplechase. Some of these athletes were seriously quick - for example the 800m race was won in 1 minute 47 seconds (by Joseph Sajeesh of India).

Naturally I was there armed with the camera and took just over [100 photos from the evenings racing](http://rowephoto.co.uk/athletics/5308668) which can now be found over at the Rowe Photo website.

[Results from the event](http://www.smuc.ac.uk/news/news340.htm) can be found at the St. Mary's website and a short report is online at the [UK Athletics website](http://www.ukathletics.net/press-centre/news-archive/june-2008/05-06-08-st-marys-report/).
