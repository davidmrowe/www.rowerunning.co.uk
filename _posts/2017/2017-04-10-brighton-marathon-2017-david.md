Well... this is an easy blog to write. I didn't take part! I withdrew from the race a couple of weeks ago.

I started training 'proper' just after Christmas and started building up my weekly long runs (12 miles, 13 miles, 15.75, 15, 16, 17) and then on 9th February on a short run in advance of an 18 miler planned for the following day I stumbled badly on a large pebble (or similar) on the promenade close to home and twisted my ankle. It was hurting so much that I had it x-rayed the following day. I stopped all training and just over a week later I ran a parkrun. My ankle still didn't feel right.

I didn't run a step for six weeks after the parkrun (on the 18th February) and ran a parkrun on 1st April - and it was hard work. I think my ankle is a lot better but trying to run a marathon on no run training would be a foolish idea. So I withdrew from the race.

Sharon and I did go and support and had a great time. It was hot (not 'Kona' hot, but hot) and the race looked amazing. I doubt I'll enter it in 2018. Maybe in a couple of years time I'll go back. We'll see.

My planned training log has now been removed from the fridge door at home. It was all going so well...
