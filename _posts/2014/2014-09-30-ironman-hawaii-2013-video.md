Regular readers of this blog may have noticed that I went to Hawaii in October 2013. You may have also noticed that Sharon and I had a pretty good time!

Well, to get my friends who are about to fly out to Kona excited about what's coming up I have at last put together a little video of what we got up to last October. Enjoy.
