I could write lots of words about the first few days here in Nice but I won't. Instead here's a few words and lots of photos...

On Thursday three of us rode to Monaco to play silly buggers on the Formula 1 track around the town. We drunk coffee (that wasn't ridiculously priced) and Shaun had two punctures.

On Friday after a little swim I headed out on the bike to have a look at the first 20km or so of the course (i.e., the first short sharp steep climb). It was hot. A lovely cycle back along the Promenade des Anglais (where the marathon takes place on Sunday) and then the race briefing and pasta party in the evening...

Saturday began with a swim out to the Compressport 'Teas of Nice' speedboat for a drink and some freebies, then followed by a relaxing lunch with friends and then off to rack my bike ready for the race. Then it was rest and relax, rest and relax, rest and relax...

So that's it. I'm ready (well, I'm not really but I'm as ready as I can be). I'm looking forward to a tough swim, a long tough scenic ride and then a run. I'll run as far as I can and with a bit of luck it'll be about 26.2 miles. Let's just wait and see...
