Well, today I got my official rejection from the 2007 Flora London Marathon. I was pretty sure it was going to be that was after my cheque was cashed a few weeks ago (depending on the date cashed you can be pretty certain whether you're in or out).

I'm not too bothered (well, I would have loved to have done it), but I think I'll find myself another marathon to do in 2007 (Abingdon in October?), and then try and do London some other time to enjoy it, and not see it as a challenge of my first ever marathon.
