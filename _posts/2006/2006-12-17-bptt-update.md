Here's a quick update from the [Bushy Park Time Trial](http://www.bptt.net) from Saturday 16 December. Sharon couldn't make it as she was working so it was up to myself to represent the Rowe's!

Well, I didn't disappoint, and got a personal best (PB) that I am incredibly pleased with. 19:40 for the 5km course which was six seconds that the PB I set on 14 November.

The course was fairly slippery (well, the grass bits) and on the final straight keeping well to the right of the muddy path worked for me.

I've got a couple of injuries at the moment, with my left hip aching (its done that before, not sure why), but my left calf is playing up most, and this has been since the Bedford Half Marathon last weekend. I'm going to ease of fast training for now, although next weekend (Christmas) is going to be a busy one, with a couple of 5k's to do.

After 11 races (I've done them all) I'm still third in the 2007 league which I'm really happy with. My overall aim is to be top 10 by the end of the year (October 2007), which if I keep my attendance up should be perfectly possible.
