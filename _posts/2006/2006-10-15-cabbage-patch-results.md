Boy, that was tough. The weather was perfect for the run today and I managed to get round in 71:47, a full 13 seconds inside of my target (289th out of 1396 finishers)! The start and first mile was pretty congested, and then it got better from there. The last mile was tough, real tough and with what seemed to be dodgy mile marker placement, seemed pretty long....

For info, here's my semi-accurate mile splits (miles in brackets) from my new Polar watch/mileometer thingy! - (1)7:07, (2)6:50, (3)6:57, (4)6:56, (5)6:57, (6)6:53, (7)7:09, (8)7:12, (9)7:20, (10)7:10, overrun 0:51. Average heart rate was 175bpm, pace per mile was 7:11.

Oh, and here's what I just posted on the Runners World forum...
