So here's a strange one. Just checked the post this morning and my marathon entry envelope was delivered back to me. The royal mail sorter must have decided to scan the return address on the back of the envelope! I'm surprised the postman didn't ask me to pay for the unstamped mail!!

So, back it goes to the post box hoping that the machine will read the address in dark bold print this time around.
