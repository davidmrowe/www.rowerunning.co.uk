...and in English, another personal best (time) at the Bushy Park Time Trial. Well, the fog that's been causing travel chaos for much of this week lifted this morning, and so did the temperature (just), and I put in a superb personal best, 20 seconds quicker than last weeks one. I'm not sure where this came from, especially as I had beer, wine, champagne, a burger and a chinese meal for my food on Friday (well, it was the last day of work before Christmas)!!!

I've also now moved up to second in the 2007 gents league, which will no doubt be as high as I can get, before slowly moving down the places when some of the faster runners start catching me up in the points.
