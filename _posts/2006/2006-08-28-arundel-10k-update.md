Here's what I just posted at the Runners World forum...

> Well, since the last 10k I did in May (the extremely flat Bognor Regis Prom 10k) I got round this (un-flat) course only 9 seconds slower! Comfortably inside of 45 minutes and I'm chuffed to bits with that.

> The course had lovely views, although the first 4k's or so being uphill was certainly tough. Coming back down on the grass was hard work - it's when you're trying to slow yourself down that's difficult, especially on that terrain....and then, you turn to the right and see another uphill - now that was a nightmare! (am I selling this well?)
> 
> All in all excellent stuff, and it was lovely to start and finish in the centre of Arundel with 99% of the spectators in the area. Oh, and orange sqaush at the finish, how civilised :)

My official time was 44:35 which I'm really happy with. I was 65th out of 561 finishers. First place finished in 34:22, and last was in 1:36:35.
