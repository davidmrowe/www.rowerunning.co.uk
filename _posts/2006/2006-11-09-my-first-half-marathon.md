After kinda being talked into it by a fellow Richmond Park Sunday morning runner (hi Bertie!), I've just sent my cheque off for the Bedford Harriers Half Marathon, being held on 10 December. After the Cabbage Patch 10 a few weeks ago, I think I'm getting into this.

Still waiting to hear about London '07, should get an idea in early November, and then confirmation in December.
