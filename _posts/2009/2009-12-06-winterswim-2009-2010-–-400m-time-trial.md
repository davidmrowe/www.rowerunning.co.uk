As part of the #winterswim time trials, every other period is a 400m time trial. This is a great way to monitor progress as you get to do this once a month during the winter.

Between 23rd November and today, 6th December we had to clock our best 400m time. Previously I'd clocked 6:48 so I wondered how I would get on this time around.

Well, in summary very little has changed. On 25 November I clocked a 6:47 and did exactly the same a few days ago as well. At least I'm consistent....

Starting tomorrow is a 100m200m period. Its going to be a lung buster!
