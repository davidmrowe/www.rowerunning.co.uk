The end of 2008 has arrived and its time to look back at this years running (and triathlon). The [2007 summary is also available](/2007/12/2007-running-summary-david/).

2008 has been up/down/up/down because of injury with the main problems around March and November. Other than that I've managed to get some good training in and squeezed out a couple of PB's (personal bests).

My total mileage was 1028 (compared with 1320 in 2007), with an average weekly mileage of 19.6 miles. My highest weekly mileage was 55 miles (in March), towards the end of Marathon training. A couple of weeks later it all fell apart with a [torn calf muscle](/2008/03/marathon-log-week-13/) which meant I was unable to take part in my first marathon in April.

Looking at my mileage month-by month it's clear that my calf injury in March took it's toll, and I built my mileage back up to goodo levels in August in preparation for the Vitruvian triathlon in September. Towards the end of September [I twisted my ankle](/2008/09/sprankled-ankle/). I made an initial recovery in early October and at the end of the month decided to give it a chance to heal, and took the whole of November off of running. I kick started my running again in December starting with the Barbados Half Marathon (as you do!)

My priorities for 2008 were to run a marathon in April and complete a middle distance (approximately Half Ironman distance) triathlon. As for the marathon, injury stopped that from happening, although Sharon and I did go and [support our friend Kirsty in the race](/2008/04/bungay-black-dog-marathon-6-april-2008/), which was run in absolutely horrific conditions - snow and ice!

I competed in one "sprint" triathlon at the end of August and was really pleased to [finish in 20th position overall](/2008/08/thames-turbo-triathlon-25-august-2008/). The race lasted just over an hour and was incredibly tough, but the result was worth it.

OK, let's look at races. In 2007 I ran over 80 races (including Bushy Park Time Trials) and lots of road running races. This year I decided to only enter races that I wanted to do rather than ones that just happened to be part of the club race series. I ran 26 Bushy Parkruns (that's their new name), and one Brighton & Hove Parkrun. I've yet to make it to any other [Parkruns](http://www.parkrun.com) but I would like to do Glasgow, Banstead and Wimbledon in 2009.

Other than running as part of the four triathlons I entered, I ran 12 'proper' road races.

- 06 Jan: Woodcote and Goring 10k (40:56)
- 26 Jan: South of England XC Championships (Parliament Hill) (1:04:50)
- 10 Feb: Chessington Valentines 10k (39:52)
- 24 Feb: Tunbridge Wells Half Marathon (1:29:37)
- 18 May: Bognor Regis Prom 10k (39:18)
- 01 Jun: Dorking 10m (1:06:48)
- 14 Jun: Welsh Castles Relay (Stage 10 - Llanfair Caereinion to Newtown) (1:34:52)
- 25 Jul: Wedding Day 7k (26:44) \[19 second PB\]
- 14 Aug: The Stragglers Club 10k (38:54) \[3 second PB\]
- 19 Oct: Cabbage Patch 10m (1:06:02)
- 07 Dec: Barbados Half Marathon (1:43:01)
- 26 Dec: The Stragglers Cabbage Patch 4m (25:27)

So, a total of 39 running only races, and 4 triathlons. I managed a couple of running PB's. 19 seconds at the Wedding Day 7k race in July, and a 3 second PB over 10k distance. I plan to get another 10k PB in 2009. Watch this space.

My favourite races.... the [Bognor 10k](/2008/05/bognor-prom-10k-18-may-2008/) was as fun as ever - the weather was great and I enjoyed the support. The [Barbados Half Marathon](/2008/12/run-barbados-festival-2008/) was fantastic, even if my time wasn't, and the experience of running [Parliament Hill](/2008/01/south-of-england-cross-country-championships-26-january-2008/), the home of Cross Country running was something special.

The toughest race had to be my stage of the [Welsh Castles Relay](/2008/06/welsh-castles-relay-14-15-june-2008/). I wasn't feeling great and the stage I ran is a renowned 'killer', and I have to agree with that.

Triathlon-wise, I have to say that the bike leg of the Bala middle distance race was incredibly tough - and being the fool that I am I plan to do it all again in 2009!

So, what's the plan for 2009... The main aim is to get fit and ready for [Ironman Switzerland](http://ironman.ch) in July. This is a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and a marathon run (26.2 miles) so I'll be doing lots of triathlon training during the first few months. On the way to this I'll be running the London Marathon in April and no doubt a few other races on and off during the year.

Stay tuned...
