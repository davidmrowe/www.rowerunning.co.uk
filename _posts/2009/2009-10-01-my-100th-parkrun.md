Saturday 19th September saw me run my 100th parkrun...that's quite a long way when you add it all up! The tradition is that you are then presented the following week with the famous 100 Club top and matching jacket. I had been a little sneaky and got my 100 top the week previously so that I could wear it under my red 50 Club top and take off the 50 just before the start. This I did (luckily without removing both at once accidentally!) and one lady was heard to say, "Ooh that's impressive"...I think she meant my tee removing!

So, that's me, a fully fledged member of the ninja-tee wearing 100 Club. The Club is growing and I think it's something to really be proud to be a part of. I ran my first parkrun in September 2006 so almost 3 years to the day I joined the 100 Club. That means that for roughly 2 out of 3 Saturday mornings for the past 3 years I have run at a parkrun...what do you mean I have no life?
