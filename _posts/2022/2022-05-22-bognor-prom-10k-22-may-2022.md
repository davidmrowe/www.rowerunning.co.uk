This is my 14th time running this event.  I last [blogged about it in 2016](/2016/05/bognor-prom-10k-15-may-2016/) but did run it in 2017
and 2019. I've no idea why I didn't blog about it those years - I remember in 2019 it was a week 
before Ironman Lanzarote so I was probably excited about that race to write about a 10k!

2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the pandemic so my entry from 2020 was deferred until now.  Whenever anyone over the past couple of 
years has asked me if I'm training for any races my reply has always been "yes, for the Bognor 10k."

Prior to the race (I'm writing this bit a few days before) my aim is to go under 40 minutes.  That 'should' be very achievable as I've been
running really well over the past few months and have recently got new 5km personal bests at the Bognor Regis parkrun - which I've been running
regularly since it started in May 2014.  So... if the conditions are good I think I'm going to aim for something closer to 39 minutes and just 
see what happens.  If it's feeling easy at half way then I'll push harder in the second half but if it's not my day then it's just not my day 
and I'll try and stay just ahead of the 40 minute pacers.

Either way I'll just be happy to be out running my favourite running race.
