In September 2014 David qualified at Ironman Wales for the [Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii](http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman/world-championship.aspx). Qualifying for the 2015 Hawaii Ironman gave David over 12 months to prepare.  Injury and clumsiness has made getting to the start line in one piece a challenge in itself but what follows is a (hopefully) daily update from Hawaii in the build up to the 2015 Ironman World Championship.

I give you… the Kona Diaries 2015…
