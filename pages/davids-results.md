David took up running in 2006, although had completed a few 10k &#8216;races&#8217; in the years before.  His first 10k was the Run London event in Richmond Park in September 2002 where he finished in over 1 hour 15 minutes.  His 10k times rapidly improved (partly through training and also after losing over 70lbs in weight) and in May 2007 he broke the 40 minute barrier for the first time.  In April 2009 he ran his first marathon.

His first triathlon was in May 2007 (a short &#8216;sprint-distance&#8217; race) and he slowly built up to half-ironman distance and then Ironman races.  In August 2013 he surprised himself (and many others) by winning the M40-44 age group at Ironman UK in a time of just under 10 hours &#8211; thus qualifying him for the 2013 Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.

In September 2014 he raced Ironman Wales and qualified for the 2015 Ironman World Championship.
